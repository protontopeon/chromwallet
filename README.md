Chrome extension wallet for ndau

ndau has a wallet on android and iOS but does not have a browser extension based wallet.  Browser wallets such as metamask are keystones in blockchain adoption.  Browser wallets are needed in order to sign transactions for any web application.  Without a browswer wallet no web applications can function because none of the twenty or so ndau transaction types can be signed.

The ndsh ndau shell has a transaction signature in it already, that could be used as a base line for the transaction signing on the web wallet.

Chrome has one of the largest user bases so it would be the optimal starting browswer out of the existing web browsers.
